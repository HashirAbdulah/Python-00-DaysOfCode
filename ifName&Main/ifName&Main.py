# In Python, the statement if __name__ == "__main__": is commonly used to control the execution of code when a Python file is run directly v/s when it is imported as a module in another file. This construct is often referred to as the "main guard" or "script guard."

# ifName&Main_example.py

import module as m
print("This is ifName&Main_example, running directly.")
m.say_hello()
